<h1 align=center><u>Text Formating tags</u></h1>
<h4>
The following HTML tags are used to format the appearance of the text on your web page. 
This can jazz up the look of the web page, however, too much variety in the text formatting can also look displeasing.
</h4><br>
<h4>Text level elements are normally used for words and sentences. They markup small bits of text and help to change thier appearance. Text level elements may be nested within one another.
</h4>
<br>
<p>Following are the Text level Tags:</p>


<dl>

<dt>&lt;big&gt; tag</dt>
 <dd><big>The <big> tag makes the text appear in a larger font. i.e, it has the same effect as <font size=+1>.</big></dd>

 <dt>&lt;small&gt; tag</dt>
 <dd><small>Instead of having to set a font size, you can use the small tag to render text slightly smaller than the text around it. Useful for displaying the 'fine-print'.</small></dd>

<dt>&lt;b&gt; tag</dt>
 <dd><b>The text in between the tags will be bold, and stand out against text around it, the same as in a word processor.</b></dd>

 <dd><i>Also working the same way as a word processor, italics displays the text at a slight angle.</i></dd>

<dt>&lt;u&gt; tag</dt>
